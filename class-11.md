## Images
* images are important to design and convey information
* have height and width attribute, and distort if alter aspect (the ratio between those attributes)
* float is great for allowing other element to flow the direction the isn't floating
* center align horzontall by making it a block with defined width, and the set left and righ margins to auto
* vertical alignment has own attribute called ```vertica
*  could also text-align element its parent which align it like text (center, left, right, justified)
* ```background-image``` with ```repeat x``` and ```repeat y```how I made the lines for chololate-pizza
* postion can have these values: left top, left center, left bottom, center top, center center, center bottom, right top, right center, right bottom, 
* those can be shorthaned as values within the same background
* image rollovers and sprites. It is possible to use CSS to turn link or button into image aka rollover & a third style when you click it.
* when an image is used from several parts it is known as a sprite. The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser needs to request one image instead of many images making the page load faster. 
* Gradients; background colors can blend into each other using these. This is how it's written: -moz-linear-gradient(two color values)
* the contrast of background images is important for website visibility
* examples are pages 422-424
